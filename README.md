On the home page, you can use the dashboard to create new patient records.
The patients that already have been recorded in the data base, will be shown on your home page. 

You can add the following for each patient:
- name
- surname
- address
- contact_details
- medicare_number
- date_of_birth
- height
- weight
- blood_type

To access each patient's details, you have to click on their name.
You will be lead to the patient's details page. 
There, you can see the recorded information.
To remove a patient from your home page, use the remove button and to update patient info, use the update button.

If you are only updating one or two of the details, you can leave the already typed in input and it will stay in system. 
Warning: do not remove the records unless you are updating them, otherwise they wont show in next page.

There is also the Add Treatment button, that will take you to the next page to add your treatment notes for this patient.
You can add the following for your notes:
- Medication History
- Medical History
- Correspondence/medical imaging 
- Results/could include your objective notes, medication results or your treatment approach


On this page, you will see the treatment notes history button, which will take you to the treatment notes recorded.
If you click on each record, it will take you to that patient treatment history page.

Update treatments feature will be added later on.
